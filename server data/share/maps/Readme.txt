paste your 'group.txt' and 'group_group.txt' from share/locale/xx in here

to generate the file open a console and run 
`py GenerateUniqueEntitiesFromMap.py`

it will create a file named "preload.txt", copy this file to client/pack/root

NOTE:
For old group.txt and group_group.txt, please use `py Old_GenerateUniqueEntitiesFromMap.py`

The "support" for old group structures was done in a rush, I don't think it's parsing everything.
If any of you has some free time, feel free to update it and open a pull request.
